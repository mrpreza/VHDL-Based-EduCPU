# VHDL-Based-EduCPU
A VHDL/Java-based Computer Organization and Design project demonstrating processor architecture concepts, instruction execution, and system-level design. Includes source code, documentation, and simulation files.


## 📖 Project Overview
The project is structured to showcase important phases of computer organization:

1. **Instruction Set Simulation**  
   - Implements a simplified instruction set architecture (ISA).  
   - Demonstrates fetching, decoding, and executing instructions.  

2. **Control Unit Design**  
   - Models control flow for arithmetic, logical, and memory operations.  
   - Highlights the separation between datapath and control.  

3. **Processor Organization**  
   - Explores registers, ALU operations, memory interactions, and I/O.  
   - Provides an educational foundation for understanding CPU internals.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java** (primary implementation language)  
- **Simulation models** for instruction processing  
- Standard I/O for testing and validation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/COdesign.git
cd COdesign
````

### 2. Compile the project

```bash
javac src/*.java
```

### 3. Run the project

```bash
java src/Main
```

## ✅ Example

Sample input (assembly-like instructions):

```text
LOAD R1, 5
ADD R1, R2
STORE R1, 100
```

Sample output:

```text
R1 <- 5
R1 <- R1 + R2
Memory[100] <- R1
```

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Extend the instruction set with more operations.
* Add pipelining simulation.
* Implement cache and memory hierarchy modeling.
* Provide a GUI visualization of processor execution.
